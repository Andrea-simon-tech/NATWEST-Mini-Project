# NATWEST-Mini-Project
This mini project focuses on early risk identification using customer transaction and balance trends, inspired by a NatWest-style retail banking use case. The goal was to identify early warning signals of customer risk by analysing behavioural patterns and financial activity.
The project follows a clear analytics pipeline:

SQL for data cleaning and transformation

Excel maintained as a raw data source (no manual manipulation)

Power BI for interactive dashboarding and insights

Business Problem

Banks need to proactively identify customers who may be entering a riskier financial state before default or adverse events occur. Traditional static reporting often fails to capture early behavioural changes.

This project addresses:

How customer transaction frequency and balance trends differ by risk segment

How early-risk customers can be identified before they become high-risk

How analytics can support preventive action and monitoring
